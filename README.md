An interactive storefront that runs in the console using node

How It Works

This program consists of an app called bamazonCustomer.js, allows a "customer" to place an order from the Bamazon store. 
A check is then performed on the store inventory and the customer is either alerted that their order cannot be completed, or 
they are shown the total amount owed. When a customer makes a transaction on Bamazon, the quantity ordered by 
the customer is deducted from the store quantity that is stored in a SQL table. The images folder shows what the app looks like in action.
